# -Galactic-object-classification
## This work was done in collaboration with astronomy researchers from the National University of Colombia. 

In this project, we took a subset of 110.000 spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and tested different approaches for dimensionality reduction and classification models to identify the kind of object based on the spectra it emits
